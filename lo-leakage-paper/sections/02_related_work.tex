\paragraph{Reasoning benchmarks.}
A large literature evaluates LLMs on reasoning problems; many datasets risk conflating reasoning with memorized knowledge.
\TODO{Add 2--4 citations relevant to general reasoning benchmarks.}

\paragraph{Linguistics Olympiad benchmarks.}
\iolbench~\cite{goyal2025iolbench} digitizes IOL problems and evaluates frontier LLMs on multiple answer types.
Our work complements this line by (i) extending to additional competitions and (ii) explicitly measuring leakage via isomorphic variants.

\paragraph{Data contamination and memorization.}
Prior work has studied training-data contamination in benchmark evaluations.
\TODO{Add 2--3 citations on contamination/memorization analysis.}
