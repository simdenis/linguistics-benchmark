\section{Limitations and Ethics}
\label{sec:limitations}

\paragraph{Licensing.}
We distribute only derived, structured instances and links to source materials where appropriate, and keep PDFs local.
\TODO{Confirm permissions/terms for each competition.}

\paragraph{Contamination claims.}
Our results should not be interpreted as proof of explicit memorization of any particular source.
We present aggregate evidence that surface-form perturbations can substantially change outcomes.

\paragraph{Responsible release.}
We include reproducible scripts and cached outputs.
We avoid releasing any private test sets.

\paragraph{Coverage.}
We exclude low-quality scans and problems that cannot be reliably auto-graded (e.g., non-Latin scripts or free-form reasoning), which may bias coverage toward cleaner sources.
