\paragraph{Interpreting the memorization gap.}
A non-zero \gap can arise from memorization, brittle heuristics, or genuine sensitivity to superficial formatting.
We interpret \gap as a diagnostic rather than a definitive proof of training-data exposure.

\paragraph{What isomorphic variants do and do not test.}
Variants aim to preserve structure while breaking exact surface matches.
They do not fully control for changes in linguistic difficulty introduced by renaming or reordering.
\TODO{Add empirical sanity checks: human solvability unchanged, etc.}

\paragraph{Implications for benchmark design.}
We recommend reporting variant performance alongside original performance for public, web-available benchmarks.
